# UIKit Examples
I realized that UIKit does not have that much examples, so here i am making examples.

## List of Examples

* First Example

## Plans
* A simple documentation page example
* Article Page Example

## Note
> There might be unnecessary classes or some mistakes, if you come across to something like this you can send a issue or you can fix and send as a pull request 👍
