# UIKit Examples
I realized that UIKit does not have that much examples, so here i am making examples.

## List of Examples
* All Examples ([Inspect Collection](https://codepen.io/collection/nmpxde))
* Example 1 ([Inspect](https://codepen.io/yussufjpg/pen/vYNoaKo))
* Personal Page ([Inspect](https://codepen.io/yussufjpg/pen/dyGoyoZ))
* Personal Page 2 ([Inspect](https://codepen.io/yussufjpg/pen/KKVWovV))
* Pricing Page ([Inspect](https://codepen.io/yussufjpg/pen/VweejyW))

## What's New
* Personal Page 2

## Future Plans
* A simple documentation page example
* Article Page Example

## Note
> There might be unnecessary classes or some mistakes, if you come across to something like this you can send a issue or you can fix and send as a pull request 👍

> I only test these templates with Google Chrome Presets so it might look bad in spesific resolutions.
